Kafka:
Queuing (One-to-one ) And Publish-subscribe(one-to-many): One-to-many.
Scale: Can send millions of messages/second.
Persistency: yes
Any message queue that allows publishing messages decoupled from 
consuming them is effectively acting as a storage system for 
the in-flight messages. 
What is different about Kafka is that it is a very good storage system. 
It provides data persistency and stores streams of records that render 
it capable of exchanging quality messages.
